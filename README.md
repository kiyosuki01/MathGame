# Math Game
This is my my first C# Console Application using Visual Studio 2022.
Console-based math game for solving addition, substraction, multiplication and division problems.
# Requirements
- [x] When you launch the application, the main menu should be displayed to select any option.
- [x] Once the main menu is displayed, you can choose between Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Random Game, Game History, and Change the game Difficulty from 1 to 3.
- [x] Every time you finish a game, your results will be saved in the game history and you can check it through the Main Menu -> Game History.
- [x] The random game should give you random 4 operation tasks for 5 times.
- [x] The app should end when you press 8 in the Main Menu or use the combination CTRL+C.
- [x] Errors will be corrected as they are found.
